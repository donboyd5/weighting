class Microweight:
    """Class with data and methods for microdata weighting.

        Common terms and definitions:
        h: number of households (tax records, etc.)
        k: number of characteristics each household has (wages, pensions, etc.)
        s: number of states or geographic areas

        xmat: h x k matrix of characteristics for each household
        wh: 1 x h vector of national weights for households
        whs: h x s matrix of state weights for households (to be solved for)
            for each household, the sum of state weights must equal the
            total household weight

        beta: s x k matrix of poisson model coefficients
            (same for all households)
        delta: 1 x h vector of poisson model constants, 1 per household
            these values are uniquely determined by a given set of beta
            coefficients and the wh values
