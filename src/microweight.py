    Note: beta %*% xmat can get very large!! in which case or exp will be Inf.
    It will get large when a beta element times an xmat element is large,
    so either beta or xmat can be the problem.

    In R the problem will bomb but with numpy it appears to recover
    gracefully.

    According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40726490/overflow-error-in-pythons-numpy-exp-function
      For most practical purposes, you can probably approximate
        1 / (1 + <a large number>) to zero. That is to say, just ignore the
      warning and move on. Numpy takes care of the approximation for
      you (when using np.float64).

    This will generate runtime warnings of overflow or divide by zero.
